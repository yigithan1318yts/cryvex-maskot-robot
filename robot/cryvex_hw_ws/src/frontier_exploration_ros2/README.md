`frontier_exploration_ros2` is a powerful open-source autonomous exploration package built for modern mobile robots. It is fast, reliable, and designed to make autonomous exploration feel practical, polished, and ready for real-world use.

Built and validated with ROS 2 Jazzy & Humble, it is still written with flexibility in mind. It fits naturally into Nav2-based projects, custom ROS 2 systems, and broader robotics workflows without making the exploration logic feel locked to a narrow setup.

More than a basic frontier package, it brings smarter exploration decisions and a stronger overall design. With map optimization before frontier detection, target ordering inspired by Minimum Ratio Traveling Salesman Problem (MRTSP), and an efficient modern C++ implementation, it offers a more capable and more refined exploration experience.

The MRTSP path also supports a bounded-horizon Dynamic Programming solver. It scores frontier candidates, keeps the strongest pool, searches a short route ahead, and dispatches only the first target so exploration stays fast and responsive.

It also improves long-running exploration with reusable caches, less repeated computation, and controlled memory use. Clear runtime controls for preemption, suppression, QoS, and completion handling make it easier to use in real projects.

In benchmarks against a variety of exploration algorithms under shared simulation scenarios, our package excelled in path complexity, elapsed time, and distance traveled, while maintaining low CPU and RAM usage.

The package successfully completed explorations with up to 99.9% coverage across challenging environments, including complex layouts, maze-like structures, dense obstacle areas, zigzag inducing areas, and large open spaces.

## Overview

This package solves autonomous frontier exploration for occupancy-grid-based mobile robots. It detects frontiers on the boundary between known free space and unknown space, can optimize the decision map before WFD runs, selects and orders exploration targets with an MRTSP-based policy, and continues until frontier exhaustion. In the default ROS 2 integration, those targets are dispatched through Nav2.

The implementation keeps the WFD-style frontier extraction backbone and extends it with decision-map optimization before frontier extraction, MRTSP-based ordering that uses the **Minimum Ratio Traveling Salesman Problem (MRTSP)** idea, and runtime controls that are useful in production deployments:

- MRTSP solver modes: **greedy matrix traversal** or **bounded-horizon Dynamic Programming**
- pre-WFD decision-map optimization with bilateral filtering and dilation
- global and local costmap filtering during frontier validation and goal selection
- startup-only map QoS autodetect for first-time integration
- frontier snapshot caching and deterministic frontier signatures
- post-goal settle logic to avoid immediate instability after a goal is reached
- explicit controls for visible-reveal-gain preemption and blocked-goal skipping
- optional frontier suppression and suppressed-frontier waiting behavior
- optional completion-event publishing for external orchestration
- optional return-to-start behavior after frontier exhaustion
- reusable C++ library export for custom integration paths

## Performance

The following table reports average performance measurements gathered across multiple scenarios.

Similar performance scaling can be expected, but actual results may vary depending on SLAM update rates, LiDAR scan frequency, and the overall data throughput.

| Metric            | Average Exploration Package | Our Package (Nearest) | Our Package (Greedy MRTSP) |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| CPU usage range   | `%14.7 - %21.3`             | `%3.5 - %4.3`         | `%3.7 - %8.0`              |
| Average CPU usage | `%18.0`                     | `%3.7`                | `%5.0`                     |
| Memory usage      | `%0.4`                      | `%0.2`                | `%0.2`                     |
| Average RAM usage | `~100 MB`                   | `~56 MB`              | `~56 MB`                   |

Idle and load stay close to each other. Reusable caches and avoiding repeated work keep usage stable, which makes the package suitable for high-efficiency systems such as Raspberry Pi.

## Research Basis

### Frontier Based Exploration for Autonomous Robot

The paper [Frontier Based Exploration for Autonomous Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03581) describes a WFD-style frontier detector built around a two-level breadth-first search. That paper provides the frontier-extraction backbone used here: expand through reachable map cells, detect frontier cells at the known/unknown boundary, and grow connected frontier clusters from those seeds.

### Enhancing autonomous exploration for robotics via real time map optimization and improved frontier costs

The paper [Enhancing autonomous exploration for robotics via real time map optimization and improved frontier costs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97231-9) adds two key ideas used in this package: map optimization before frontier extraction and a frontier cost model for exploration ordering with **Minimum Ratio Traveling Salesman Problem (MRTSP)** approach. Together with WFD, these ideas shape the package: WFD handles frontier detection, while optimized maps and multi-factor costs improve target selection.

### Bounded Horizon Dynamic Programming

The **bounded-horizon Dynamic Programming** solver uses techniques I learned in courses at the **Computer Engineering Department** of **Yıldız Technical University**. In this package, those techniques are applied to **MRTSP ordering**: score candidates with the same start-row cost used by the MRTSP matrix, **keep the best candidate pool**, and **search a fixed-depth route** inside that pool.

This **improves ordering quality significantly** without turning frontier selection into a heavy full-route solver. The robot still dispatches only the **first frontier** from the selected sequence, then replans after **map and frontier updates**.

## Status

This package is written and tested for ROS 2 Jazzy & Humble. That target is explicit in the build, launch, and dependency surface, and future ports to other ROS 2 distributions can be considered on demand.

Even though the public deliverable is a ROS 2 package, the implementation is intentionally kept universal in structure. The exploration logic lives in a reusable C++ core, transport details stay at the node boundary, topic and QoS contracts are explicit, and completion handling remains external instead of being tied to a project-specific workflow.

In practice, that makes the package easier to reuse in Nav2 deployments, custom ROS 2 stacks, and later adaptations where the core exploration behavior needs to move into a different system layout.

## Verified Environment

The implementation has been validated in a ROS 2 exploration stack built around:

- Ubuntu 24.04 & ROS 2 Jazzy
- Ubuntu 22.04 & ROS 2 Humble
- Gazebo Harmonic
- Nav2
- Slam Toolbox
- TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi

This is not the only supported integration path, but it is a verified environment in which the package has successfully completed frontier exploration with the expected map, costmap, TF, and navigation flow.

The verified TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi setup uses a 360-degree 12.0 m range 2D LiDAR and default parameters are adjusted according to this.

Exploration parameters can be affected by LiDAR characteristics, so they should be tuned for the actual sensor and environment.

The TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi is also a relatively small and slow robot, so parameter values may need to change on bigger and faster platforms.

> [!TIP]
> This demo uses `MRTSP Scoring + Map Optimization + Early Preemption` to achieve highly efficient, smart autonomous exploration with smoother and more purposeful navigation decisions.

## Design Goals

- Provide a C++ exploration package that is fast, predictable, and easy to integrate into real robotics systems, with a verified ROS 2 Jazzy path.
- Keep WFD-style frontier extraction while improving frontier quality and exploration ordering through pre-WFD map optimization and MRTSP-based selection.
- Use a single MRTSP-style global ordering path with predictable dispatch semantics.
- Improve **MRTSP route quality** with **bounded-horizon Dynamic Programming** while keeping target selection lightweight for repeated replanning.
- Expose a clean parameter surface for topics, frames, QoS, decision-map tuning, goal behavior, and completion hooks.
- Keep the default node integration practical for Nav2 while keeping the decision logic separated from project-specific backends.
- Make namespace-aware deployment and multi-robot integration practical.
- Keep the package public and universal. The package should be usable without assuming a specific robot, simulator, map saver, or private stack.

The packaged parameter file uses **MRTSP ordering** with **bounded-horizon DP**:

```yaml
mrtsp_solver: dp
dp_solver_candidate_limit: 15
dp_planning_horizon: 10
```

To use the higher performance but **lower accuracy** greedy method, set `mrtsp_solver: greedy`.

Launch with the packaged parameter file:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py
```

The packaged launch file uses the packaged `config/params.yaml` defaults, and that baseline starts exploration immediately with `autostart:=true`.

Override the parameter file:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  params_file:=/absolute/path/to/params.yaml
```

Run under a namespace:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  namespace:=robot1
```

Enable simulation time:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  use_sim_time:=true
```

Override startup map durability:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  map_qos_durability:=volatile
```

Enable startup-only map QoS autodetect:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  map_qos_autodetect_on_startup:=true \
  map_qos_autodetect_timeout_s:=2.0
```

Keep the node in cold idle at launch time:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  autostart:=false
```

Disable the runtime control service while keeping automatic startup:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  autostart:=true \
  control_service_enabled:=false
```

### Runtime Control

When `control_service_enabled=true`, the node exposes a `control_exploration` service using `frontier_exploration_ros2/srv/ControlExploration`. This service provides an explicit runtime control surface for exploration lifecycle management. It is available even when exploration starts automatically, and is mainly useful for stop, delayed start/stop, cold-idle orchestration, and optional self-shutdown flows. If `autostart=false`, the node keeps this service enabled regardless of the configured `control_service_enabled` value so the cold-idle session can still be started.

The packaged CLI helper provides a convenient terminal interface for that service:

```bash
frontier_exploration_ctl start
frontier_exploration_ctl start -t 10
frontier_exploration_ctl stop
frontier_exploration_ctl stop -t 10
frontier_exploration_ctl stop -q
frontier_exploration_ctl stop -t 10 -q
```

Command semantics:

- `start` enables exploration. If the node is in cold idle, it recreates the required subscriptions and timers, resets session-local exploration state, and begins exploration after fresh input data arrive.
- `stop` disables exploration, prevents further goal dispatch, and returns the node to cold idle so that map and costmap traffic are no longer processed.
- `-t <seconds>` schedules the request after the given delay instead of applying it immediately.
- `stop -q` performs a normal stop sequence and then shuts down the explorer node process.

If the control service is disabled while `autostart=true`, the CLI helper and RViz control panel cannot send runtime commands to that explorer instance.

When the package is started with its own example launch file, `stop -q` also causes that launch session to exit after the explorer process stops. It does not attempt to terminate unrelated nodes, external launch parents, or arbitrary terminal sessions. Higher-level process orchestration remains outside the scope of this package.

## Rviz Plugin

`frontier_exploration_ros2` also provides an optional RViz plugin for start and stop exploration control directly from RViz.

## Greedy MRTSP vs Dynamic Programming

The MRTSP strategy can order frontiers with either a greedy matrix traversal or the bounded-horizon Dynamic Programming solver.

Greedy MRTSP is fast and useful as a baseline. It repeatedly chooses the best next frontier from the current node. This keeps the decision simple, but it only looks one step ahead.

Dynamic Programming keeps the same MRTSP cost model, then improves the route decision with limited lookahead. It scores candidates, keeps the strongest candidate pool, searches a bounded route sequence inside that pool, and dispatches only the first frontier. This preserves the package's replanning behavior while making the selected target more purposeful.

This helps when the cheapest immediate frontier leads to poor follow-up transitions. The DP solver can choose a slightly more expensive first frontier when the short route after it is better overall.

For MRTSP ordering, **Dynamic Programming** is a game-changing feature. It greatly improves decision quality by evaluating short frontier sequences instead of only the immediate next step, while adding only a small and controlled amount of extra computation through candidate pruning and a bounded planning horizon.

## Benchmark

We have tested and evaluated similar exploration packages that use different approaches in a [shared simulation environment](https://github.com/mertgulerx/autonomous-exploration-demo-benchmark).
Under these scenarios:

- [Bookstore](https://github.com/mertgulerx/autonomous-exploration-demo-benchmark#bookstore): Medium size and obstacle dense maze-like environment. Spanning **225 m² (2,400 sq ft)**.
- [Warehouse](https://github.com/mertgulerx/autonomous-exploration-demo-benchmark#warehouse): Large-scale (Six times larger than the `Bookstore`), complex and realistic environment. Spanning **1,500 m² (16,000 sq ft)**.

We gathered **single core CPU usage**, **RAM usage**, **distance traveled**, **time elapsed** and **path complexity** results, a key metric for evaluating **how efficiently robots navigate during exploration**.

### A Better Approach

In real autonomous exploration, not every tiny residual frontier is worth visiting. If very small and low-value regions are skipped, the robot can often achieve a major path reduction with only a minimal loss in total explored area.

This is especially effective in corridor-like maps, where narrow leftover fragments tend to add long detours and unnecessary turning for very little information gain.

## Architecture

The package includes these main pieces:

- `frontier_explorer`: public executable that subscribes to map and costmap topics, queries TF, and talks to Nav2 `NavigateToPose`.
- `frontier_exploration_ros2::frontier_exploration_ros2_core`: reusable C++ core library that contains frontier search, decision-map construction, MRTSP ordering, goal-state handling, settle logic, active-goal preemption, blocked-goal handling, and suppression orchestration.
- `frontier_debug_observer`: passive RViz debug executable that observes map, costmap, TF, and parameters, then publishes analysis overlays without sending goals or changing exploration behavior.
- `control_exploration`: optional typed ROS service used to start, stop, schedule, and optionally shut down the explorer process.
- `frontier_exploration_ctl`: packaged CLI helper for sending exploration control requests from the terminal.
- `launch/frontier_explorer.launch.py`: package-owned example launch file.
- `launch/frontier_debug.launch.py`: launch file for the passive debug observer.
- `config/params.yaml`: packaged baseline parameter file.
- `mrtsp_ordering`: cost-matrix construction and greedy MRTSP traversal.
- `mrtsp_solver`: **candidate pruning** and **bounded-horizon DP ordering**.
- `debug_analyzer`: read-only reconstruction of MRTSP and DP scoring for visualization.
- `debug_markers`: RViz `MarkerArray` and `OccupancyGrid` output builders for debug overlays.

At runtime, the node expects:

- an occupancy map topic
- a global costmap topic
- a local costmap topic
- a TF transform from `global_frame` to `robot_base_frame`
- a Nav2 `navigate_to_pose` action server, or another action server reachable under the configured action name

The decision path is structured in stages:

- map ingestion and occupancy-grid wrapping
- optional decision-map optimization with bilateral filtering and dilation
- WFD-style frontier extraction on the active decision map
- MRTSP ordering: materialize reachable goal points around frontier clusters, choose `greedy` or `dp` solver behavior, and dispatch the first frontier from the ordered sequence
- action dispatch, map/costmap monitoring, and runtime policy handling

The package can also publish a completion event through `std_msgs/msg/Empty`. This is intentionally optional and transport-light. The explorer only reports completion. Any map export, mission chaining, docking, or higher-level orchestration should be implemented outside the package.

The node also supports a cold-idle runtime mode. When the explorer is idle, it keeps the control service, action client, TF, and publishers available, but does not keep map or costmap subscriptions alive. This allows the package to remain available for orchestration while avoiding unnecessary map and costmap processing before exploration is started. In the packaged configuration, this mode is available when you explicitly set `autostart:=false` or stop the explorer at runtime. Cold-idle mode always keeps the control service enabled, even if `control_service_enabled=false` is requested.

Two optional debug publishers are also available:

- `selected_frontier_topic` publishes the selected target pose
- `optimized_map_topic` publishes the optimized occupancy grid used for decision making

These debug outputs are published only when debug logging is enabled for the node.

When suppression is enabled, the core can temporarily exclude repeatedly failing frontier areas and optionally wait under a temporary return-to-start goal while all detected frontiers remain suppressed. That temporary return path is separate from normal exploration completion.

## Debug Observer

The package includes a debug observer for RViz. It shows what frontier selection sees, how candidates are filtered, and how the scoring layers behave without changing exploration behavior.

### Launch

Run the observer next to an explorer instance:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_debug.launch.py
```

Use the same parameter file as the explorer when tuning a real run:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_debug.launch.py \
  params_file:=/path/to/params.yaml
```

### Debug Topics

| `explore/debug/raw_frontiers`       | Frontiers detected on the raw occupancy map                              |
| `explore/debug/optimized_frontiers` | Frontiers detected after decision-map optimization and the active target |
| `explore/debug/mrtsp_scores`        | MRTSP score rank, gain, path cost, and time cost                         |
| `explore/debug/mrtsp_order`         | Greedy or DP MRTSP sequence shown as a route overlay                     |
| `explore/debug/dp_pruning`          | DP candidate pool, prune rank, DP order rank, and pruning score          |
| `explore/debug/decision_map`        | Occupancy grid used for optimized frontier extraction                    |
| `explore/debug/chunk_cache`         | Chunk-cache borders for decision-map raw diff validation                 |

Add the debug topics as `MarkerArray` displays, and add `explore/debug/decision_map` as a `Map` display. Keep the fixed frame aligned with the configured `global_frame`, usually `map`.

The chunk-cache overlay uses these colors:

- green border: raw chunk cache hit, chunk stayed unchanged
- red border: chunk was rebuilt because the incoming raw map changed there
- yellow border: full geometry reset/full rebuild, for example after map growth or origin shift

The overlay also publishes a small text summary with chunk hit/dirty/reset counts and whether the optimized output was reused.

You can check that the observer is publishing with:

```bash
ros2 topic list | grep explore/debug
```

The observer publishes a one-time success log after the first complete overlay set is sent:

### Raw Frontiers

Topic:

```text
explore/debug/raw_frontiers
```

This overlay shows frontier candidates detected directly on the input occupancy map before decision-map optimization. It is useful for understanding what the map itself contributes before filtering, smoothing, and dilation affect the decision map.

Displayed values:

- orange points: raw frontier candidates
- no score labels: this layer is meant to show detection density, not ranking

If raw frontiers are dense but optimized frontiers are sparse, decision-map optimization is reducing candidate noise. If raw frontiers are missing in an expected area, the issue is usually in the map, occupancy threshold, costmap blocking, or frontier-size filtering.

### Optimized Frontiers

Topic:

```text
explore/debug/optimized_frontiers
```

This overlay shows the frontier candidates that remain after decision-map optimization. These are the candidates used by MRTSP scoring and DP pruning analysis.

Displayed values:

- green points: optimized frontier candidates
- white sphere: first active target selected by the current ordering

This topic is the quickest way to inspect whether the robot is choosing from the expected candidate set. When this layer differs strongly from `raw_frontiers`, the decision-map parameters are having a visible effect.

### MRTSP Scores

Topic:

```text
explore/debug/mrtsp_scores
```

This overlay explains the start-row MRTSP score for each candidate. It shows why a frontier is attractive or expensive before the full route order is built.

Displayed values:

- `rank`: rank by MRTSP start-row score; lower is better
- `score`: `M(0, j)`, the robot-to-frontier start-row cost used by the MRTSP matrix
- `gain`: information-gain proxy, based on frontier size
- `path`: initial frontier path-cost term
- `time`: lower-bound travel-time term from robot pose to candidate
- green-to-warm point color: lower score to higher score

A low score usually means the candidate has a good balance of travel cost and expected information gain. A high `gain` can help a farther frontier, but a large `path` or `time` can still make it less attractive.

### MRTSP Order

Topic:

```text
explore/debug/mrtsp_order
```

This overlay shows the analyzed MRTSP route sequence. In `mrtsp_solver: greedy`, it follows the greedy matrix traversal. In `mrtsp_solver: dp`, it follows the bounded-horizon DP sequence after pruning.

Displayed values:

- cyan route line: analyzed active order
- faint start edges: low-cost robot-to-frontier start edges
- `order=N`: candidate position in the route sequence

Only `order=1` is dispatched as the next navigation target. The remaining route is lookahead context and is recomputed after the robot moves and the map/frontiers update.

### DP Pruning

Topic:

```text
explore/debug/dp_pruning
```

This overlay explains which optimized frontiers enter the bounded-horizon DP solver. It makes the difference between all available candidates and the pruned DP candidate pool visible.

Displayed values:

- orange points: candidates kept for DP
- grey points: candidates outside the pruned pool
- `prune`: rank in the DP candidate pool, after sorting by MRTSP start-row score
- `dp_order`: position in the DP route sequence, or `-` if the candidate is pruned but not used in the selected sequence
- `score`: pruning score, equal to the MRTSP start-row score `M(0, j)`

The candidate limit controls how many orange points can appear. The planning horizon controls how many of those candidates can appear in the DP route sequence.

### Decision Map

Topic:

```text
explore/debug/decision_map
```

This overlay publishes the occupancy grid used for optimized frontier extraction. It shows the map after the decision-map optimization step, using the same occupancy threshold and optimization parameters as the observer analysis.

Displayed values:

- free, occupied, and unknown cells as a `Map` display
- smoothed and dilated structure produced by decision-map optimization
- candidate changes that explain differences between raw and optimized frontier overlays

## Algorithm and Mathematics

### Frontier Definition

The package follows the classical frontier idea: a frontier is an unknown cell that borders free space.

The eligibility test implemented in the search layer can be summarized as:

```text
frontier(p) is true if:
  map(p) = unknown
  and there exists q in N(p) such that map(q) = free
  and there does not exist q in N(p) blocked by the active costmap policy
```

`N(p)` is the local neighborhood around cell `p`. The implementation uses an 8-connected neighborhood plus the center cell for local scans.

### WFD-Style Two-Level Search

The core search keeps the WFD idea from [Frontier Based Exploration for Autonomous Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03581). The code uses two BFS layers:

1. A map-space BFS expands through reachable map cells.
2. When a frontier cell is found, a frontier BFS grows that connected frontier cluster.

The search flow is:

```text
1. Project the robot pose into map coordinates.
2. If the robot starts in unknown or occupied space, recover the closest free seed.
3. Expand a BFS over reachable map cells.
4. When a frontier cell is detected, grow the full connected frontier cluster.
5. Reject tiny clusters.
6. Build one frontier candidate from that cluster.
7. Repeat until the reachable map area is exhausted.
```

This preserves the core WFD idea while adapting it to a ROS 2 exploration stack that also reasons over global and local costmaps.

### Frontier Candidate Geometry

Each frontier cluster is converted into a `FrontierCandidate` with:

- a centroid used for ranking and equivalence checks
- a center point used as the MRTSP dispatch baseline
- a start world point used by the MRTSP path-cost calculation
- an optional reachable goal point used by navigation dispatch and preemption checks
- a cluster size used as the information-gain proxy

The centroid is computed directly from frontier cells:

```text
c_x = (1 / N) * sum(x_i)
c_y = (1 / N) * sum(y_i)
```

The node searches free and unblocked neighbors around frontier cells and selects a reachable navigation point close to the centroid:

```text
choose g that minimizes ||g - c||^2
subject to:
  g is free
  g is not blocked in the global costmap
  g is not blocked in the local costmap
  and optionally ||g - r||^2 >= d_min^2
```

Where:

- `c` is the frontier centroid
- `g` is the candidate goal point
- `r` is the robot position
- `d_min` is the active minimum-distance gate

If no goal candidate satisfies the distance constraint, the implementation falls back to the best unconstrained reachable point.

### Decision-Map Optimization

The decision-map stage is inspired by the 2025 paper and implemented directly in this package. The purpose is to reduce invalid frontiers caused by sparse sensing while preserving occupied structure.

The occupancy grid is first mapped into a paper-style image:

- occupied = `0`
- unknown = `205`
- free = `255`

Let `I(p)` be the paper-image value at cell `p`. The bilateral filter uses a spatial-domain Gaussian and a range-domain Gaussian:

```text
G_s(p, q) = exp(-||p - q||^2 / (2 * sigma_s^2))
G_r(p, q) = exp(-(I(p) - I(q))^2 / (2 * sigma_r^2))
```

The normalization term and filtered value are:

```text
W(p) = sum_{q in S} G_s(p, q) * G_r(p, q)
I_bar(p) = (1 / W(p)) * sum_{q in S} G_s(p, q) * G_r(p, q) * I(q)
```

Where `S` is the local filter support around `p`.

After filtering, the package thresholds the image back into a frontier-decision image:

- cells above the free/unknown midpoint become free
- cells below that threshold become unknown
- occupied cells from the raw image remain occupied

Finally, the package applies circular free-space dilation with radius `dilation_kernel_radius_cells` over the thresholded result. This expands filtered free support while keeping occupied cells fixed.

In practice, this stage:

- reduces invalid frontiers caused by sparse sensing
- preserves occupied cells
- keeps narrow traversable passages when the optimization parameters are tuned conservatively

### Frontier Cost Model

The package uses frontier size as the information-gain proxy:

```text
P(V_i, V_j) = size(V_j)
```

The path-cost term follows the candidate geometry used in the implementation:

```text
d(V_i, V_j) = max(d_m + d_u, d_n + d_v) - r_s
```

Where:

- `d_m` is the distance from the source frontier center point to the target frontier center point
- `d_n` is the distance from the source frontier center point to the target frontier centroid
- `d_u` is the distance from the target frontier center point to the target start world point
- `d_v` is the distance from the target frontier centroid to the target start world point
- `r_s` is `sensor_effective_range_m`

The implementation uses frontier cluster size as the gain term. The path-cost term can become negative when a candidate frontier is effectively already within sensing range. That behavior is intentional because it biases ordering toward frontiers that can expose area efficiently with less added travel.

### MRTSP Cost Matrix

Once frontier path cost and information gain are available, the package builds a directed MRTSP-style cost matrix over the robot start node and all frontier candidates.

For frontier-to-frontier transitions, the heuristic is:

```text
M(i, j) = (weight_distance_wd * d(V_i, V_j)) / (weight_gain_ws * P(V_i, V_j))
```

For start-to-frontier transitions, the package adds a lower-bound start term derived from robot translation and heading limits:

```text
M(0, j) =
  (weight_distance_wd * d(V_0, V_j)) / (weight_gain_ws * P(V_0, V_j))
  + t_lb(j)
```

With:

```text
t_lb(j) = min(
  L(robot, V_j) / max_linear_speed_vmax,
  |delta_yaw(robot, V_j)| / max_angular_speed_wmax
)
```

Matrix node `0` is the robot start node. Matrix nodes `1..M` are frontier candidates.

Three implementation details matter in practice:

- frontier dispatch uses `center_point` when no reachable navigation `goal_point` is materialized
- `frontier_map_optimization_enabled` now directly controls whether decision-map optimization is applied
- reachable `goal_point` materialization stays active because dispatch, completion-distance, suppression, and visible-gain logic all use it

### Greedy MRTSP Ordering

With `mrtsp_solver: greedy`, the package traverses the full MRTSP cost matrix one frontier at a time:

```text
current = robot_start
unvisited = all frontier candidates

while unvisited is not empty:
  choose j in unvisited with minimum M(current, j)
  append j to order
  current = j
  remove j from unvisited
```

This mode is simple, deterministic, and fast. It only optimizes the next selected edge, so it can miss a better route when a slightly more expensive first choice leads to a much better sequence afterward.

### Bounded-Horizon DP Ordering

With `mrtsp_solver: dp`, the package applies **score-based pruning** before solving the route. The pruning score is the same **start-row MRTSP cost** used in the matrix:

```text
score(j) = M(0, j)
```

Candidates are sorted by:

```text
1. lower score
2. larger frontier size
3. lower original candidate index
```

Only the first `dp_solver_candidate_limit` candidates are passed into the **DP solver**. The cost matrix is then built for that **pruned pool**, not for the full frontier list.

The **DP horizon** controls **route depth**, not the candidate pool size:

```text
candidate pool size = min(dp_solver_candidate_limit, number of candidates)
route depth         = min(dp_planning_horizon, candidate pool size)
```

The default DP profile is:

```yaml
dp_solver_candidate_limit: 15
dp_planning_horizon: 10
```

> [!WARNING]
> Bounded-horizon DP cost depends on the **processor**, the frontier count, and how much CPU budget should be reserved for exploration. On lower-power CPUs, keep `dp_solver_candidate_limit` and `dp_planning_horizon` smaller, or use `mrtsp_solver: greedy` for the lightest behavior. On stronger CPUs, values above the default can be tested, but `dp_solver_candidate_limit` is capped at `60`.

`dp_solver_candidate_limit` controls how many scored candidates enter the DP route search:

```text
dp_solver_candidate_limit = 3

score(A) = 1
score(B) = 2
score(C) = 3
score(D) = 4

candidate pool = A, B, C
```

`dp_planning_horizon` controls how deep the route search goes inside that candidate pool:

```text
K = 1

Robot -> A = 1
Robot -> B = 2
Robot -> C = 3

best route = Robot -> A
dispatch   = A
```

```text
K = 2

Robot -> A -> B
Robot -> B -> C
Robot -> C -> D
...

dispatch = first frontier of the best 2-frontier route
```

```text
K = 10

Robot -> v1 -> v2 -> v3 -> ... -> v10

dispatch = v1
```

For a **pruned pool** with `M` candidates and an **effective horizon** `K`, the solver searches:

```text
Robot -> v1 -> v2 -> ... -> vK
```

The DP state is:

```text
dp[mask][j]
```

Meaning:

```text
minimum route cost from the robot,
after visiting the candidate set represented by mask,
and ending at candidate j
```

Initialization:

```text
dp[1 << j][j] = M(0, j + 1)
```

Transition:

```text
dp[mask | (1 << k)][k] =
  min(
    dp[mask | (1 << k)][k],
    dp[mask][j] + M(j + 1, k + 1)
  )
```

Final selection:

```text
best = min(dp[mask][j])
where popcount(mask) = K
```

**Parent pointers** reconstruct the selected sequence. Only `sequence[0]` is dispatched, then the map and frontier set are refreshed before the next decision. If the **DP solver** cannot build a finite route, the core falls back to **greedy ordering** on the same pruned matrix.

The implementation keeps only the **active DP depth layer** and the parent states needed for reconstruction. This keeps memory bounded by the selected **candidate limit** and **planning horizon** instead of building a full global TSP solver.

### Costmap Blocking Policy

The package uses both global and local costmaps during search and during active-goal monitoring.

The blocking rule is intentionally strict:

```text
blocked(world_point) is true if any active costmap reports cost > OCC_THRESHOLD
```

This affects two stages:

- frontier eligibility: unknown cells next to blocked neighbors are not treated as valid frontiers
- goal-point materialization: free neighbors that are blocked in either costmap are rejected

This is one of the key extensions beyond a plain frontier-only implementation. It improves robustness in cluttered environments and reduces the number of goals that are technically frontier-adjacent but not operationally navigable.

### Deterministic Frontier Signatures

The implementation quantizes frontier reference points and goal points into a stable signature:

```text
q = max(frontier_visit_tolerance, 0.1)
signature(F) = sort(round(ref_x / q), round(ref_y / q), round(goal_x / q), round(goal_y / q))
```

This signature is used for:

- snapshot cache validation
- stable publish suppression for RViz markers
- post-goal settle checks
- MRTSP order-cache validation, together with solver mode and DP bounds

It reduces noise from small floating-point jitter and helps keep runtime behavior deterministic.

### Post-Goal Settle Logic

After a normal frontier goal result, the node does not immediately send the next goal when `post_goal_settle_enabled=true`. Instead it waits for a fixed cooldown.

The readiness rule is:

```text
ready if:
  elapsed >= post_goal_min_settle
```

This reduces rapid re-goaling after a terminal frontier result without waiting for extra map-update counters or signature stability checks.

### Preemption and Blocked-Goal Design

Two parameters are deliberately exposed as policy controls:

- `goal_preemption_enabled`
- `goal_skip_on_blocked_goal`

They are design choices, not incidental flags.

`goal_preemption_enabled` allows the active frontier goal to be reconsidered when target-pose visible reveal gain is exhausted.

`goal_skip_on_blocked_goal` allows the active frontier goal to be skipped when the target becomes blocked in the local or global costmap. If another frontier is available, the explorer moves on to it. If not, the blocked goal can be canceled explicitly.

Visible-reveal-gain preemption evaluates the target pose with an occlusion-aware visible reveal estimate. As long as that estimate says the active goal still offers useful reveal on arrival, the current goal is kept. When that gain no longer justifies staying on the active target, the explorer can switch using the refreshed frontier set.

The implementation also applies:

- a minimum time gap between visible-reveal-gain preemption attempts
- an optional completion distance that can treat a near-arrived frontier as finished, even when visible-reveal-gain preemption is disabled
- a stability requirement so replacement candidates must be observed repeatedly before a switch is made

Together, these controls help the explorer stay responsive without turning preemption into unstable goal switching.

`goal_preemption_complete_if_within_m` lets the system accept "close enough" as effectively complete and move on cleanly. This guard is independent from visible-reveal-gain preemption, so it can also recover when Nav2 does not report success even though the robot is already inside the configured frontier completion distance from the dispatched target pose. When the guard triggers, the active goal is canceled and the next normal scheduling pass uses the configured completion distance as a temporary minimum candidate distance near that completed target. This avoids immediate redispatch without doing an extra frontier-list filter in the arrival callback. It should still be used carefully on robots that prioritize conservative obstacle avoidance: if this threshold is set too large, the robot can mark a frontier complete before the intended sensing pose is meaningfully reached, which can in turn produce wrong exploration transitions.

### Frontier Suppression and Failure Memory

Suppression is an optional policy layer that temporarily removes repeatedly failing frontier goal areas from consideration without marking exploration as complete.

The implementation is reason-agnostic at the policy level. It does not try to infer whether a failure came from Nav2, another action backend, a planner limitation, or a temporary bring-up condition. Instead it tracks repeated failed attempts at the frontier goal point and promotes those failures into temporary square suppression regions.

The attempt key is quantized with the same tolerance family used elsewhere in the core:

```text
q = max(frontier_visit_tolerance, 0.1)
attempt_key(g) = (round(g_x / q), round(g_y / q))
```

Where `g` is the actual navigation goal point, not the frontier centroid.

After a configurable number of failed attempts, the implementation creates a square suppression region:

```text
center = g
side_length = frontier_suppression_base_size_m
```

If another matured failed goal lands in the outer expansion band of an existing region, the region grows instead of creating a second nearby fragment:

```text
inner square  = C x C
outer square  = (C + B) x (C + B)
if g is in outer - inner:
  new_center = midpoint(old_center, g)
  new_side_length = 2 * C
```

Where:

- `C` is the current region side length
- `B` is `frontier_suppression_expansion_size_m`

Membership is evaluated with the selected goal point. The suppression policy does not use the centroid for region filtering.

The suppression state is also bounded by design:

- failed attempt records are stored in a capped hash map
- suppression regions are stored in a capped vector
- both use TTL-based cleanup
- both use oldest-entry eviction if the configured hard cap is reached

That keeps the feature operationally safe for long-running deployments.

### No-Progress Detection

Suppression also includes a no-progress watchdog for accepted frontier goals.

The watchdog reads `distance_remaining` from the action feedback stream and tracks the best observed value. A goal is considered to have made meaningful progress only when the best distance improves by at least `frontier_suppression_progress_epsilon_m` since the last meaningful progress point.

The rule can be summarized as:

```text
meaningful_progress if:
  distance_at_last_progress - best_distance_remaining >= progress_epsilon
```

The timeout rule is:

```text
no_progress if:
  now - last_meaningful_progress_time >= no_progress_timeout
```

There is no separate time window attached to `frontier_suppression_progress_epsilon_m`. The expected interpretation is:

- achieve at least that much meaningful improvement
- before `frontier_suppression_no_progress_timeout_s` expires

If that does not happen, the active frontier goal is canceled and counted as a failed attempt.

### Startup Grace Period

Suppression is intentionally delayed during startup when `frontier_suppression_startup_grace_period_s` is greater than zero.

During that grace period, suppression filtering, failed-attempt recording, and no-progress cancelation stay disabled. This helps avoid poisoning suppression memory while Nav2, TF, or costmaps are still stabilizing.

### Suppressed-Frontier Waiting Policy

`All detected frontiers are temporarily suppressed` is not the same condition as `No more frontiers found`.

The first means frontier candidates still exist but are temporarily excluded by suppression. The second means frontier search found no candidates at all.

When all current candidates are suppressed, `all_frontiers_suppressed_behavior` controls the response:

- `stay`: wait in place for map or costmap changes
- `return_to_start`: temporarily navigate back to the recorded start pose

This temporary return behavior is separate from `return_to_start_on_complete`. It does not mark exploration complete, and it is canceled automatically if usable frontier candidates appear again.

## Integration Guide

### Required Interfaces

The node expects the following interfaces to exist in the running system:

| Interface             | Default                  | Purpose                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Occupancy grid topic  | `map`                    | Frontier extraction and decision-map input                            |
| Global costmap topic  | `global_costmap/costmap` | Reachability and blocked-goal filtering                               |
| Local costmap topic   | `local_costmap/costmap`  | Near-field blocked-goal filtering                                     |
| Nav2 action           | `navigate_to_pose`       | Goal execution                                                        |
| TF transform          | `map -> base_footprint`  | Robot pose lookup                                                     |
| Frontier marker topic | `explore/frontiers`      | Visualization                                                         |
| Control service       | `control_exploration`    | Optional runtime start, stop, schedule, and quit control when enabled |

### Topic and Frame Mapping

For most integrations, only these fields need to be remapped:

- `map_topic`
- `costmap_topic`
- `local_costmap_topic`
- `navigate_to_pose_action_name`
- `global_frame`
- `robot_base_frame`
- `frontier_marker_topic`
- `selected_frontier_topic`
- `optimized_map_topic`

All defaults are relative topic names inside the package-owned baseline config. That keeps the package namespace-friendly in multi-robot deployments. If your system uses absolute topic names, provide them explicitly in your parameter file.

### Nav2 Integration

The public node is designed around `nav2_msgs/action/NavigateToPose`.

The explorer:

- waits for the action server with a bounded timeout
- dispatches one frontier goal at a time
- receives feedback and result callbacks
- can request cancelation during preemption flows

If your stack wraps Nav2 behind a namespace or a remapped action name, update `navigate_to_pose_action_name` accordingly.

If suppression is enabled, repeated rejected goals, aborted goals, or no-progress timeout cancelations can temporarily remove a frontier area from selection.

### Multi-Robot and Namespace Use

The launch file accepts a `namespace` argument and all packaged topic defaults are relative. That makes the package suitable for:

- one explorer per robot namespace
- one Nav2 stack per robot namespace
- one map and costmap graph per robot namespace

Example:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  namespace:=robot1 \
  params_file:=/absolute/path/to/robot1_frontier.yaml
```

### Completion Event Consumption

When `completion_event_enabled` is `true`, the explorer publishes one `std_msgs/msg/Empty` message when frontier exhaustion is observed.

Completion event QoS:

- durability: `transient_local`
- reliability: `reliable`
- depth: `1`

Design intent:

- the explorer reports completion
- external systems decide what to do next
- late-joining subscribers can still see the latest completion event while the explorer node remains alive

Typical consumers include:

- map export services
- docking or return-home supervisors
- mission sequencers
- test automation scripts

Suppressed return-to-start is different. If `all_frontiers_suppressed_behavior=return_to_start`, the robot may temporarily go back to the start pose while waiting for new frontier opportunities, but that does not publish a completion event and does not mean exploration has finished.

### Reusing the C++ Core Library

The package exports a reusable C++ target:

```cmake
find_package(frontier_exploration_ros2 REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_explorer src/my_explorer.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_explorer
  frontier_exploration_ros2::frontier_exploration_ros2_core
)
```

The core separates the exploration logic from the public node for custom ROS 2 integrations.

### Suppression Behavior in Practice

Suppression is most useful in systems where the same frontier can fail repeatedly for operational reasons that are not visible in the occupancy map alone. Common examples include:

- a navigation stack that comes up later than the explorer
- a planner that keeps rejecting a narrow or unstable goal area
- a controller that stalls near clutter without making meaningful progress
- a temporary map or costmap inconsistency during bring-up

In those cases, suppression adds three controls:

- startup grace delays suppression until the initial system bring-up window has passed
- failure memory temporarily removes repeatedly failing goal areas from reselection
- optional temporary return-to-start behavior avoids treating the situation as exploration complete

If the frontier set changes and a usable candidate appears again, the temporary return-to-start goal is canceled and frontier exploration resumes automatically.

| Channel          | Default durability | Default reliability           | Default depth                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Map              | `transient_local`  | `reliable`                    | `1`                           |
| Global costmap   | `volatile`         | `reliable`                    | `10`                          |
| Local costmap    | `volatile`         | `inherit` from global costmap | `inherit` from global costmap |
| Completion event | `transient_local`  | `reliable`                    | `1`                           |

The local costmap subscriber always uses volatile durability. Reliability and depth can either inherit the global costmap settings or be overridden explicitly.

### Startup-Only Map Durability Autodetect

If the correct map durability is not known during first integration, the package can probe it at startup.

Behavior:

1. Start with the configured map durability.
2. Wait for `map_qos_autodetect_timeout_s`.
3. If no map is received and the configured durability is `transient_local` or `volatile`, switch once to the opposite durability.
4. If a map arrives, lock that choice and stop autodetect.
5. If neither attempt succeeds, stop autodetect and report failure.

This process is strictly startup-only. It does not keep switching at runtime.

### Autodetect Log Meanings

The node emits machine-parsable logs with a fixed prefix:

```text
[qos-autodetect] START selected=<durability> timeout=<seconds>
[qos-autodetect] SWITCH selected=<durability> elapsed=<seconds>
[qos-autodetect] COMPLETE result=<initial|fallback|failed> selected=<durability> elapsed=<seconds>
```

Interpretation:

- `result=initial`: the first configured durability worked
- `result=fallback`: the fallback durability worked
- `result=failed`: neither attempt received a map within the startup window

Recommended integration sequence:

1. Enable autodetect once during bring-up.
2. Read the `COMPLETE` log.
3. Copy the working durability into your permanent parameter file.
4. Disable autodetect for regular deployments.

Suppression does not define its own QoS policy, but it is still relevant during first integration. If map QoS is wrong or the navigation stack comes up late, the explorer can observe unstable early behavior. The recommended pattern is:

1. fix map QoS first
2. use startup grace while validating navigation bring-up timing
3. then tune suppression thresholds only after the transport layer is stable

Notes:

- `params_file` controls the full YAML source for the node.
- the launch file only overrides `autostart`, `control_service_enabled`, the QoS-related parameters listed above, and `use_sim_time`
- all other node behavior is defined by the selected parameter file
- MRTSP solver selection, decision-map tuning, suppression behavior, startup grace, and suppressed-frontier waiting policy are configured in YAML, not through dedicated launch arguments

## Parameter Reference

Parameters are declared in `frontier_explorer_node.cpp`.

The packaged launch path uses `config/params.yaml` as its baseline parameter file, so launched behavior may differ from the declared defaults where that YAML intentionally overrides them. Notable examples are `occ_threshold` and `goal_preemption_enabled`: the node declares `50` and `false`, while the packaged YAML sets `60` and `true`.

    # --------------- MRTSP Scoring --------------- #

    # Weight applied to the path-cost term in the frontier cost matrix.
    # Increasing this makes the explorer more distance-sensitive and conservative.
    # Decreasing it makes information gain dominate more often.
    # Example: 2.0 prefers closer frontiers, 0.5 allows farther high-gain picks.
    weight_distance_wd: 1.0

    # Weight applied to the frontier information-gain term.
    # Larger values favor large frontier clusters that promise more map expansion.
    # Smaller values make the robot clean up nearby small frontiers first.
    # Example: 2.0 may skip small room corners, 0.5 tends to clear them sooner.
    weight_gain_ws: 1.0

    # Max linear speed used only in the lower-bound time term.
    # It does not command the robot directly; it estimates how fast a frontier
    # can be reached when building the first row of the cost matrix.
    # Larger values reduce the time penalty of distant frontiers.
    max_linear_speed_vmax: 0.50

    # Max angular speed used in the heading-change part of time lower bound.
    # This matters most when candidate frontiers require large initial turns.
    # Larger values reduce the penalty of reorientation-heavy options.
    # Example: low values prefer frontiers already near the current heading.
    max_angular_speed_wmax: 1.0

    # Effective sensor range subtracted inside the paper's path-cost term.
    # Larger values reduce the effective traversal penalty between frontiers.
    # This favors frontiers that can reveal more space from farther away.
    # Example: 0.5 makes costs distance-heavy, 2.0 rewards sensing reach more.
    # Doesn't have to be a real sensor value. Used for distance scoring.

    # --------------- Navigation Safety --------------- #

    # Distance used to treat a frontier region as recently visited.
    # Use if you are having navigation loops.
    frontier_visit_tolerance: 0.40

    # --------------- Map Optimization --------------- #

    # Minimum allowed distance from robot to a consider a frontier point as valid.
    # This prevents selecting trivially close frontiers that do not move exploration.
    # Higher values reduce local dithering but can skip useful nearby openings.
    # Example: 0.25 allows immediate local cleanup, 0.5 forces a small commit distance.
    # Recommended value: 2.5x size of robot's radius
    frontier_candidate_min_goal_distance_m: 0.8

    # Occupancy threshold applied to the global costmap during frontier validation.
    # Neighbor cells at or above this cost are treated as blocked for frontier tests.
    # Lower values make the explorer avoid inflated-cost regions more aggressively.

    # Value between 0-100. Use higher values if exploration skips very small areas.

    # Minimum connected frontier size accepted by WFD, measured in cells.

    min_frontier_size_cells: 5

    # Spatial sigma of the bilateral filter in map cells.
    # Larger values smooth over wider neighborhoods before frontier extraction.
    # Too low preserves noise; too high can merge narrow openings unrealistically.
    # Example: 1.0 keeps details sharp, 3.0 makes corridors look cleaner but broader.
    sigma_s: 2.0

    # Range sigma of the bilateral filter in occupancy-image intensity space.
    # Larger values let dissimilar neighboring cells influence each other more.
    # Small values preserve occupancy edges; large values can blur free/unknown borders.
    # Example: 10.0 is edge-preserving, 50.0 is much more permissive.
    sigma_r: 30.0

    # Free-space dilation radius after bilateral filtering, measured in cells.
    # This expands filtered free regions before running WFD on the optimized map.
    # Higher values help bridge tiny gaps, but can also over-open door thresholds.
    # Example: 0 keeps the map literal, 2 can merge thin fragmented frontiers.
    dilation_kernel_radius_cells: 1

    # --------------- Preemption --------------- #

    # Treat the current frontier as complete once the robot is this close to it; 0.0 disables this shortcut.
    # This close-enough guard also works when visible-gain preemption is disabled, but obstacle-avoidance-heavy robots should use it carefully because large values can end a frontier too early and trigger wrong exploration choices.

### Example Launch

Assuming TurtleBot3, SLAM, and Nav2 are already running:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  params_file:=/absolute/path/to/tb3_waffle_pi_frontier.yaml \
  use_sim_time:=true
```

For a namespaced robot:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  namespace:=tb3 \
  params_file:=/absolute/path/to/tb3_waffle_pi_frontier.yaml \
  use_sim_time:=true
```

### What To Verify During Bring-Up

- `/map` is available and uses the expected QoS profile
- `/global_costmap/costmap` is available
- `/local_costmap/costmap` is available
- `map -> base_footprint` exists in TF
- `navigate_to_pose` is reachable
- the LiDAR scan quality is stable enough for SLAM, decision-map optimization, and costmap updates
- the robot can receive and complete Nav2 goals before exploration is started
- if you use debug inspection, the selected frontier and optimized map topics are visible while debug logging is enabled
- the completion event topic is subscribed by an external consumer if post-processing is needed
